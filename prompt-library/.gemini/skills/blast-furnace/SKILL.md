# Blast Furnace Protocol (Alchemy of Code)

## 1. Ore Selection (Identify the Legacy)
* **Analyze:** What made the old version special?
    * *Example:* "v3.1 had a very aggressive 'Push Back' capability that I miss in the polite v3.3."
* **Extract:** Isolate that specific prompt logic into a raw text block.

## 2. The Smelting Process (Merge)
* **Context:** Take the CURRENT architecture (Compound Engineering).
* **Injection:** Inject the old trait as a "Constraint" or "Style Guide".
* **Conflict Resolution:** If Old contradicts New, prioritize **Engineering Integrity** (v3.3), but keep the **Tone/Vibe** of Old.

## 3. Forging the Alloy (Output)
Generate a `heritage/` file.
* **Filename:** `heritage/v3.1_aggressive_pushback.md`
* **Content:**
    > "Applying the 'Steve Jobs' critique style to the v3.3 Review Logic."

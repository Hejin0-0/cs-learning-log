# Agentic Engineering Philosophy (v3.4)

## 0. From Coder to Orchestrator (Trend 1)
> "We do not just write code. We manage the agents that write code."

1.  **High-Level Intent:** Focus on *Why* and *What*. Let the Agents handle *How*.
2.  **Intelligent Collaboration:** Agents only ask for human help on **Strategy** & **Ambiguity**, not syntax.
3.  **Full-Stack Democratization:** Empower non-experts (Designers, Marketers) to build via natural language.

## 1. The Long-Running Protocol (Trend 3)
Agents must behave as if they are working for days, not minutes.
* **State Persistence:** Always update `docs/progress/status.md` after every turn.
* **Self-Correction:** If an error occurs, analyze the root cause *before* asking the human. Try to fix it twice.
* **Async Mindset:** Don't wait for the next prompt. Propose the "Next 3 Steps" in advance.

## 2. Economic Velocity (Trend 6)
* **Viability Check:** "Is this project feasible now?" (Previously too expensive/slow).
* **Tech Debt:** Use agents to aggressively pay down debt during idle cycles.
